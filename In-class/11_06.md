#Notes for November 6
Consider

double x = x + x
and an evaluation of

double (fact 10)
By name - call by name semantics

  double (fact 10)
= fact 10 + fact 10
= 3628800 + fact 10
= 3628800 + 3628800
= 7257600
By need - call by need semantics, lazy evaluation

  double (fact 10)
= x + x  where x = fact 10
= x + x  where x = 3628800
= 3628800 + 3628800 where x = 3628800
= 3628800 + 3628800
= 7257600
