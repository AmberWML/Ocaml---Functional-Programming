### Show: euclid m n = gcd m n

Induction on structure of the computation

Base case: m = n

  euclid m n 
= m
  by def of euclid
= gcd m n           
  by specification of gcd

### Inductive cases: m < n Ind. Hyp. : euclid m (n - m) = gcd m (n - m)

  euclid m n 
= euclid m (n - m)
  by def of euclid
= gcd m (n - m)
  by ind. hyp.
= gcd m n
  by specifications of gcd
Inductive cases: m > n ... very similar ...
