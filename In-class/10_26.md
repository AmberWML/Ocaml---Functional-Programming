# Note
## How can we evaluate ths following:
Let ("x", Int 5, Add (Int 4, Id "x"))
[] - empty environment

the entire expression[ ("x", 5) ]

this is the environment for Add (Int 4, Id "x")
## How cana we evaluate this one?
-Add (Int 4, Mul( Int 3, Id "x")), here we don't know what the environment is.

Let( "x", Int 3,
      Add( Mul (Int 2, Id "x"),
           Let( "x", Int 4,
                     Add (Int 5, Id "x"))))


-This is, essetially let x = 3 in (2 * x) + (let x = 4 in 5 + x) []

-for the entire expression[ ("x", 3) ]

-for the first add expression, this the rest of the outer most let [ ("x", 4); ("x", 3) ] --- keep them both

-for the innermost Add our lookup function, starts at the front of the list

## What about this? 

Let( "x", Int 3,
      Add( Mul (Int 2, Id "x"),
           Let( "y", Add (Id "x", Int 4),
                     Add (Id "x", Id "y"))))
[ ("y", 4), ("x", 3) ]
